To install, just unzip FullBNT.zip, start Matlab, and proceed as follows
{{{
>> cd C:\kmurphy\FullBNT\FullBNT-1.0.4
>> addpath(genpathKPM(pwd))
>> test_BNT
}}}

The genpathKPM function is like the builtin genpath function, but it does not add directories called 'Old' to the path, thus preventing old versions of functions accidently shadowing new ones. The warnings occur because Matlab 7 added functions with the same names as my functions. The BNT versions will shadow the built-in ones, but this should be harmless.
Note: the functions installC_BNT etc. are not needed anymore: all C code has either been removed or is unnecessary.

Note: as mentioned above, with new versions of matlab you will get lots of warning messages, but everything should still work.

Note: Cory Reith tells me that, as of 15 Sep 2009, octave 3.2.2 can run most of BNT. Please send email to crieth@ucsd.edu if you have questions.
