== Supported probabilistic models ==
 
 
It is trivial to implement all of
the following probabilistic models using the toolbox.



* Static 
 *  Linear regression, logistic regression, hierarchical mixtures of experts
 *  Naive Bayes classifiers, mixtures of Gaussians, sigmoid belief nets
 *  Factor analysis, probabilistic PCA, probabilistic ICA, mixtures of these models
*
* Dynamic 
 *  HMMs, Factorial HMMs, coupled HMMs, input-output HMMs, DBNs
 *  Kalman filters, ARMAX models, switching Kalman filters, tree-structured Kalman filters, multiscale AR models
*
*  Many other combinations, for which there are (as yet) no names!
